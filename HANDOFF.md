# Secure Video Summarizer - Development Handoff

## Session Progress

### Completed
1. Fixed dependency management in `start_svs_application.py`:
   - Moved third-party imports into functions
   - Added proper dependency checking before imports
   - Created script-level virtual environment for dependencies
   - Added `psutil` and `requests` to script dependencies

2. Fixed port configuration:
   - Standardized backend port to 8081
   - Standardized frontend port to 8080
   - Updated port references in configuration files

3. Added missing dependencies:
   - Added `google-auth-oauthlib` to `requirements.txt`
   - Added `psutil` to `requirements.txt`

4. Removed redundant shell scripts in favor of Python implementations:
   - Removed `create_feature_branches.sh` → `create_feature_branches.py`
     - Purpose: Creates feature branches for development
     - Python version provides better error handling and cross-platform compatibility
   - Removed `setup_branches.sh` → `setup_branches.py`
     - Purpose: Sets up development branches and configurations
     - Python version offers more robust branch management
   - Removed `run_app.sh` → `start_svs_application.py` and `stop_svs_application.py`
     - Purpose: Manages application startup and shutdown
     - Split into two Python scripts for better process management and error handling

### Current Issues
1. Backend fails to start with error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'google_auth_oauthlib'`
   - Package is in requirements.txt but not installed in virtual environment
   - Need to reinstall backend dependencies

2. Frontend fails to start with error: `Could not find a required file. Name: index.js`
   - `index.js` was created but appears to be missing
   - Need to verify file location and permissions

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Fix**:
   - Deactivate and remove existing backend virtual environment
   - Create fresh virtual environment
   - Install all dependencies from requirements.txt
   - Verify backend server starts correctly

2. **Frontend Fix**:
   - Verify `index.js` location in `frontend/src/`
   - If missing, recreate `index.js` with proper React initialization
   - Verify frontend server starts correctly

3. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test communication between frontend and backend
   - Verify all routes and endpoints are working
   - Test the complete application flow

## Recent Changes
- Reorganized imports in `start_svs_application.py`
- Added dependency checking before third-party imports
- Added `google-auth-oauthlib` to `requirements.txt`
- Standardized port configuration across the application
- Created script-level virtual environment for dependencies
- Removed shell scripts in favor of Python implementations for better cross-platform compatibility

## Known Issues
1. Backend fails to start with error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'google_auth_oauthlib'`
2. Frontend fails to start with error: `Could not find a required file. Name: index.js`

## Environment
- OS: darwin 24.3.0
- Python version: 3.13
- Node.js environment for frontend
- Virtual environments are being used for both backend and frontend

## Notes
- The application uses a hybrid approach with Python backend and React frontend
- Port configuration: Backend on 8081, Frontend on 8080
- The startup script (`start_svs_application.py`) handles both servers
- Script-level virtual environment (.script_venv) is used for startup script dependencies
- All shell scripts have been replaced with Python implementations for better cross-platform compatibility and error handling
