# CI/CD Documentation

This section provides comprehensive information about the continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline for the Secure Video Summarizer project.

## Pipeline Overview

The CI/CD pipeline automates the testing, building, and deployment processes, ensuring high quality and consistent releases. Our pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and consists of several stages from code commit to production deployment.

## CI Pipeline

- [CI Pipeline Setup](ci_pipeline_setup.md) - How to set up and configure the CI pipeline
- [GitHub Actions Workflow](github_actions_workflow.md) - Details of GitHub Actions configuration
- [Test Automation in CI](test_automation_ci.md) - How automated tests are integrated into the CI pipeline
- [Pipeline Reports](pipeline_reports.md) - Understanding CI/CD pipeline reports

## CI Workflow Stages

1. **Code Commit** - Developer commits code to repository
2. **Static Analysis** - Automated linting and code quality checks
   - ESLint for JavaScript
   - Pylint for Python
   - SonarQube for comprehensive code quality
3. **Unit Tests** - Automated testing of individual components
   - Backend: pytest with coverage reporting
   - Extension: Jest with coverage reporting
4. **Integration Tests** - Testing component interactions
   - API endpoint testing
   - Cross-component functionality
5. **Build Verification** - Ensure the application builds successfully
   - Backend server package creation
   - Chrome extension package creation
6. **Performance Tests** - Performance benchmarking (only on major changes)
   - Response time measurements
   - Resource utilization tests
7. **Security Scans** - Automated security checks
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - OWASP security rules verification
