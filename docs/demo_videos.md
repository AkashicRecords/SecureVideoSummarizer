This document outlines the process for creating and using demo videos to showcase the Secure Video Summarizer application.

## Video Types

We recommend creating the following types of demo videos:

1. **Quick Overview (30-60 seconds)**
   - Introduction to the application's purpose
   - Key differentiators (privacy, local processing)
   - What problems it solves

2. **Feature Showcase (2-3 minutes)**
   - Video upload and processing
   - Summarization with different options
   - Browser extension integration
   - LLM integration demonstration

3. **Tutorial Videos (1-2 minutes each)**
   - Installation on macOS
   - Installation on Windows
   - Setting up Google OAuth
   - Configuring the browser extension

## Required Tools

To create high-quality demo videos, you'll need:

1. **Screen Recording Software**
   - macOS: QuickTime Player (built-in) or ScreenFlow
   - Windows: OBS Studio (free) or Camtasia
   - Cross-platform: Loom

2. **Video Editing Software**
   - Basic: iMovie (macOS), Windows Video Editor
   - Advanced: Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve

3. **Audio Equipment**
   - External microphone recommended for clear narration
   - Quiet recording environment

4. **Sample Content**
   - Prepare sample videos for summarization
   - Educational videos work best (5-10 minutes in length)
   - Ensure you have rights to use the content

## Recording Guidelines

For consistent, professional demo videos:

1. **Pre-Recording Setup**
   - Close unnecessary applications
   - Use a clean desktop background
   - Set display resolution to 1920x1080
   - Test audio levels before recording

2. **During Recording**
   - Speak clearly and at a measured pace
   - Pause briefly between actions
   - Highlight mouse movements deliberately
   - Use keyboard shortcuts for smoother transitions

3. **Content Tips**
   - Start with a clear introduction
   - Explain each step as you perform it
   - Highlight security/privacy features
   - Show both successful operations and error handling
   - End with a call to action (visit website, download, etc.)
