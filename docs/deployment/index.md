# Deployment Documentation

This section provides comprehensive information about deploying the Secure Video Summarizer application across different environments.

## Deployment Overview

The Secure Video Summarizer application consists of two main components that need to be deployed:
1. **Backend Server**: Python-based API server that processes videos and generates summaries
2. **Chrome Extension**: Browser extension that interacts with video platforms and communicates with the backend
