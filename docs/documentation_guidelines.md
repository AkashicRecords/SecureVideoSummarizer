# Documentation Guidelines

## Introduction

This guide outlines the standards and process for maintaining the Secure Video Summarizer documentation. Consistent documentation helps team members and users quickly find information and understand the system.

## Documentation Structure

All documentation in the Secure Video Summarizer project follows a consistent structure:

1. **Overview** - Introduction and purpose
2. **Installation** - Prerequisites and installation steps
3. **Setup & Configuration** - How to configure and start the component
4. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions
5. **Under the Hood** - Technical details for developers

## Using the Template

A template file is provided at `docs/template.md` to ensure consistency. To use this template:

1. Copy the template file to the appropriate directory (e.g., `docs/integrations/` for new platform integrations)
2. Rename the file to match your component (e.g., `new_platform_integration.md`)
3. Fill in each section with relevant information
4. Update the index file (`docs/index.md`) to include a link to your new documentation

```bash
# Example: Creating documentation for a new platform integration
cp docs/template.md docs/integrations/new_platform_integration.md
```

## Documentation Generation Script

To simplify the creation of new documentation files, use the provided script:

```bash
./scripts/create_docs.sh <doc_type> <doc_name>
```

Where:
- `<doc_type>` is the type of documentation (integration, user_guide, troubleshooting, development, or root)
- `<doc_name>` is the name of the documentation file (without the .md extension)

Example:
```bash
./scripts/create_docs.sh integration vimeo
```

This will:
1. Create a new file at `docs/integrations/vimeo.md` using the template
2. Replace the title with "Vimeo"
3. Provide instructions for next steps

The script automatically creates directories if needed and prevents accidental overwrites of existing documentation.

## Template Sections Guide

### Overview

Keep the overview concise (2-3 paragraphs) and focus on:
- What this component or integration does
- Why it's valuable
- How it fits into the overall system

### Installation

Split into "Prerequisites" and "Installation Steps" subsections:
- Prerequisites should list all dependencies, system requirements, and pre-installation setup
- Installation steps should be numbered and include command examples where applicable

### Setup & Configuration

Include:
- Configuration options in table format
- Environment setup with code examples
- Getting started steps to verify successful setup

### Troubleshooting

Follow the format:
- Issue name as heading
- Symptoms as bullet points
- Causes as bullet points
- Solutions as numbered steps or bullet points

### Under the Hood

Should include:
- Architecture diagrams (ASCII or images)
- Key files table
- API reference with endpoints, parameters, and response examples
- Data flow description
- Integration points with other system components

## Formatting Standards

### Markdown Conventions

- Use `#` for main headings, `##` for sections, `###` for subsections
- Use backticks (`` ` ``) for inline code and triple backticks (`` ``` ``) for code blocks
- Use tables for structured information
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Use bullet points for non-sequential items

### Code Examples

- Include language identifier after opening triple backticks (e.g., ```python)
- Keep examples concise and focused
- Include comments for complex examples

### Links

- Use relative links to other documentation files
- Use absolute links for external resources
- Check links regularly to ensure they're not broken

## Maintenance

### Review Process

All documentation changes should be reviewed for:
- Technical accuracy
- Completeness
- Adherence to the template structure
- Grammar and spelling

### Update Frequency

- Update documentation immediately when code changes affect functionality
- Review all documentation quarterly for accuracy
- Mark outdated sections with a "NEEDS UPDATE" note until they can be revised

## Contribution Process

1. Create or update documentation following these guidelines
2. Submit documentation changes with related code changes
3. Request review from both technical and documentation reviewers
4. Address feedback and merge changes

## Documentation Tools

The following tools are recommended for documentation creation and maintenance:

- **VS Code** with Markdown extensions for editing
- **markdownlint** for Markdown linting
- **Grammarly** or similar for spell checking
- **Mermaid** or **PlantUML** for diagrams (if needed)

By following these guidelines, we can maintain high-quality, consistent documentation throughout the Secure Video Summarizer project.
