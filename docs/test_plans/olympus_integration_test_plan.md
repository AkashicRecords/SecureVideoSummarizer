## Test Cases

### Functional Test Cases

| ID | Test Case | Description | Steps | Expected Result | Priority | Dependencies |
|----|-----------|-------------|-------|----------------|----------|--------------|
| OLY-TC-01 | Video Detection | Test detection of Olympus videos | 1. Navigate to Olympus course<br>2. Open video<br>3. Check extension status | Extension detects video and shows active icon | High | Extension installed |
| OLY-TC-02 | Transcript Extraction | Test extraction of transcript from video | 1. Open Olympus video<br>2. Click "Generate Transcript"<br>3. Wait for processing | Transcript extracted and displayed correctly | High | OLY-TC-01 |
| OLY-TC-03 | URL Processing | Test processing of shared Olympus URLs | 1. Copy Olympus video URL<br>2. Use "Process URL" feature<br>3. Wait for processing | URL processed successfully and transcript generated | Medium | Backend API implementation |
| OLY-TC-04 | Authentication Handling | Test behavior with logged out user | 1. Log out from Olympus<br>2. Attempt to process video<br>3. Observe error handling | Appropriate error shown with instructions to log in | Medium | None |
| OLY-TC-05 | Error Recovery | Test recovery from temporary network issues | 1. Start processing<br>2. Temporarily disconnect network<br>3. Restore connection<br>4. Observe recovery | System should retry and complete successfully | Medium | OLY-TC-02 |

### Performance Test Cases

| ID | Test Case | Description | Success Criteria | Priority |
|----|-----------|-------------|------------------|----------|
| OLY-PERF-01 | Processing Time | Measure time to process videos of different lengths | Transcript generation < 30s for 5min video | High |
| OLY-PERF-02 | Resource Usage | Monitor CPU and memory during transcript processing | Memory usage < 500MB, CPU < 50% for 1 minute | Medium |
| OLY-PERF-03 | Concurrent Processing | Test handling multiple requests simultaneously | Successfully process 3 videos concurrently | Low |

### Security Test Cases

| ID | Test Case | Description | Success Criteria | Priority |
|----|-----------|-------------|------------------|----------|
| OLY-SEC-01 | Data Protection | Verify no sensitive data is exposed in logs or transmissions | No PII or credentials in logs or network traffic | High |
| OLY-SEC-02 | Authorization | Test access to only authorized Olympus content | Unauthorized content returns appropriate error | High |
| OLY-SEC-03 | Input Validation | Test handling of malformed Olympus URLs | Proper validation with informative error messages | Medium |

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Olympus platform changes its video player | High | Medium | Implement monitoring and auto-detection of changes; develop rapid response plan |
| Rate limiting or API restrictions | Medium | High | Implement backoff strategies and caching; monitor usage patterns |
| Network instability affecting tests | Medium | Medium | Run tests in stable environment; add retry logic and timeout handling |
| Test account access revoked | High | Low | Maintain multiple test accounts; document process for quickly provisioning new accounts |

## Appendix

### Test Data Setup

```bash
# Create test directories
mkdir -p test_data/olympus/videos
mkdir -p test_data/olympus/transcripts

# Download sample test videos (if permitted)
python scripts/fetch_test_videos.py --platform olympus --count 5

# Set up mock responses
cp test_fixtures/olympus_responses.json test_data/
```

### Test Scripts

```python
# Example test script for Olympus video detection
def test_olympus_video_detection():
    # Initialize browser and navigate to test video
    browser = setup_test_browser()
    browser.navigate_to('https://mygreatlearning.com/courses/test-course/video')
    
    # Wait for video player to load
    browser.wait_for_element('#olympus-player')
    
    # Verify extension detects video
    extension_state = browser.execute_script('return window.svsExtension.getState()')
    assert extension_state['videoDetected'] == True
    assert extension_state['platform'] == 'olympus'
    
    # Cleanup
    browser.close()
```
