## CI/CD and Deployment

### CI/CD Pipeline

Our continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline ensures that all code changes are automatically tested and deployed when ready.

#### CI Pipeline Configuration

- [CI Pipeline Setup](ci_cd/ci_pipeline_setup.md) - How to set up and configure the CI pipeline
- [GitHub Actions Workflow](ci_cd/github_actions_workflow.md) - Details of GitHub Actions configuration
- [Test Automation in CI](ci_cd/test_automation_ci.md) - How automated tests are integrated into the CI pipeline

#### CI Workflow Steps

1. **Code Commit** - Developer commits code to repository
2. **Static Analysis** - Automated linting and code quality checks
   - ESLint for JavaScript
   - Pylint for Python
   - SonarQube for comprehensive code quality
3. **Unit Tests** - Automated testing of individual components
   - Backend: pytest with coverage reporting
   - Extension: Jest with coverage reporting
4. **Integration Tests** - Testing component interactions
   - API endpoint testing
   - Cross-component functionality
5. **Build Verification** - Ensure the application builds successfully
   - Backend server package creation
   - Chrome extension package creation
6. **Performance Tests** - Performance benchmarking (only on major changes)
   - Response time measurements
   - Resource utilization tests
7. **Security Scans** - Automated security checks
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - OWASP security rules verification

### Deployment Pipeline

#### Development Environment

- [Dev Environment Setup](deployment/dev_environment.md) - Setting up the development environment
- [Deployment to Dev](deployment/dev_deployment.md) - Steps for deploying to the dev environment
- Automatic deployment on successful CI builds to development branch

#### Staging Environment

- [Staging Environment](deployment/staging_environment.md) - Setting up the staging environment
- [Deployment to Staging](deployment/staging_deployment.md) - Steps for deploying to staging
- Deployment triggered by successful dev environment testing and manual approval

#### Production Environment

- [Production Environment](deployment/production_environment.md) - Setting up the production environment
- [Deployment to Production](deployment/production_deployment.md) - Steps for production deployment
- Deployment requires successful staging tests and release manager approval

#### Deployment Steps

1. **Environment Preparation**
   - Configuration file updates
   - Database migrations
   - Service dependencies verification

2. **Deployment Execution**
   - Backend server deployment
   - Chrome extension publishing
   - Database updates

3. **Post-Deployment Verification**
   - Health checks
   - Smoke tests
   - Performance verification

4. **Rollback Procedures**
   - Automated rollback triggers
   - Manual rollback steps
   - Data recovery procedures

### Infrastructure as Code

- [Infrastructure Setup](deployment/infrastructure_setup.md) - Setting up infrastructure using code
- [Configuration Management](deployment/configuration_management.md) - Managing environment configurations
