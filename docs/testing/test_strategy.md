# Testing Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy, methodologies, and procedures for the Secure Video Summarizer project. It provides guidelines for developers and QA engineers to ensure the application meets quality standards and functions as expected across all components.

## Test Plan

### Testing Goals

The primary goals of our testing effort are to:

1. Ensure functional correctness of all features
2. Verify security of user data and processes
3. Validate performance and reliability under various conditions
4. Confirm cross-platform compatibility
5. Ensure smooth integration between components

## Backend Testing

### API Testing

API endpoints are tested using pytest with the following approach:

1. **Setup**: Create test data and authentication tokens
2. **Execution**: Send requests to endpoints
3. **Verification**: Validate responses against expected results
4. **Cleanup**: Remove test data

Example API test:

```python
def test_youtube_process_endpoint():
    # Setup
    auth_token = generate_test_token()
    test_data = {"video_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=test123"}
    
    # Execution
    response = client.post(
        "/api/youtube/process", 
        json=test_data, 
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {auth_token}"}
    )
    
    # Verification
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert "transcript" in response.json()
    assert "summary" in response.json()
    
    # Cleanup
    cleanup_test_session(response.json()["session_id"])
```

### Integration Testing

Backend integration tests focus on:

1. Database operations
2. External service interactions (video platforms)
3. LLM service integration
4. File system operations

Tests include mocked external dependencies when appropriate.

### Mock Testing

For tests that require external services like YouTube or Olympus:

1. Create mock responses for video downloads
2. Simulate transcription responses
3. Mock LLM responses for summaries

Example mock setup:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_youtube_downloader(monkeypatch):
    def mock_download(*args, **kwargs):
        return {
            "status": "success",
            "file_path": "/tmp/test_video.mp4",
            "metadata": {
                "title": "Test Video",
                "duration": 120
            }
        }
    
    monkeypatch.setattr(
        "app.utils.youtube_downloader.YouTubeDownloader.download", 
        mock_download
    )
```

## Frontend/Extension Testing

### Unit Testing

Extension components are tested with Jest:

```javascript
test('VideoDetector detects YouTube videos', () => {
  document.body.innerHTML = `
    <div id="player" data-video-id="test123"></div>
  `;
  
  const detector = new VideoDetector();
  const result = detector.detectYouTube();
  
  expect(result).toBeTruthy();
  expect(result.videoId).toBe('test123');
});
```

### End-to-End Testing

End-to-end tests simulate user interactions:

1. Launch browser with extension installed
2. Navigate to video platforms
3. Interact with extension UI
4. Verify expected behavior

## Testing Platform Integrations

### YouTube Integration Testing

Tests for YouTube integration include:

1. Video detection on various YouTube page layouts
2. Handling of different video types (standard, shorts, premieres)
3. Error handling for region-restricted or private videos
4. Performance with videos of different lengths

### Olympus Integration Testing

Tests for Olympus integration include:

1. Video detection on Olympus platform
2. Transcript extraction from Olympus player
3. Error handling for unavailable content
4. Authentication handling

## Test Data Management

### Test Videos

Test videos are stored in a dedicated repository:

- Short test videos (< 1 minute)
- Medium test videos (1-10 minutes)
- Long test videos (> 10 minutes)
- Videos with different languages
- Videos with poor audio quality

### Transcript Test Data

Transcription test data includes:

- Known transcripts for comparison
- Multi-language transcripts
- Technical content with specialized vocabulary
- Transcripts with timing information

## Continuous Integration

### CI Pipeline

The CI pipeline includes the following test stages:

1. **Linting**: Code style and quality checks
2. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components
3. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
4. **Build Tests**: Ensure application builds correctly
5. **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows
6. **Performance Tests**: Test under load conditions

### Test Reporting

Test results are reported via:

- GitHub Actions summaries
- Detailed test logs
- Test coverage reports
- Performance benchmarks

## Manual Testing

### Test Cases

Key manual test cases include:

1. Extension installation and first-time setup
2. Video detection across supported platforms
3. Summary generation with different video types
4. Error handling and recovery
5. Cross-browser compatibility

### Exploratory Testing

Guidelines for exploratory testing:

1. Focus on one feature or component per session
2. Document unexpected behaviors
3. Try edge cases and unusual inputs
4. Test with different user permissions
5. Report detailed steps to reproduce issues

## Testing New Features

### Test-Driven Development

For new features, follow the TDD approach:

1. Write failing tests that define the expected behavior
2. Implement the feature to make tests pass
3. Refactor while maintaining passing tests
4. Add integration tests to verify component interaction

### Feature Flags

Use feature flags for testing in production:

1. Deploy new features behind flags
2. Enable flags for internal testing
3. Gradually roll out to user segments
4. Monitor performance and errors
5. Disable flags if issues are detected

## Issue Management

### Reporting Test Failures

When reporting issues:

1. Provide a clear title describing the problem
2. Include steps to reproduce
3. Attach relevant logs and screenshots
4. Specify environment details
5. Assign severity and priority

### Test-Based Bug Fixing

When fixing issues:

1. Create a test that reproduces the issue
2. Implement the fix
3. Verify the test passes
4. Add regression tests if needed

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing

Load tests simulate concurrent users:

1. Simulating multiple extension requests
2. Testing backend processing capacity
3. Measuring response times under load

### Resource Monitoring

During testing, monitor:

1. CPU and memory usage
2. Database performance
3. Network throughput
4. Error rates

## Security Testing

### Vulnerability Scanning

Regular scans for:

1. Dependency vulnerabilities
2. API endpoint security
3. Authentication mechanisms
4. Data encryption practices

### Penetration Testing

Periodic penetration tests focusing on:

1. API security
2. Extension vulnerabilities
3. Data exfiltration attempts
4. Authentication bypass

## Test Automation

### Automation Framework

The test automation framework includes:

1. Custom test runners for different test types
2. Shared fixtures and utilities
3. Reporting and notification integrations
4. CI/CD integration

### Maintenance

Test maintenance procedures:

1. Regular review of test cases
2. Updating tests for UI changes
3. Enhancing test coverage for new features
4. Refactoring brittle tests
